YASS is a pure TypeScript implementation of Peter Norvig's <a href="https://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Sudoku Solver</a> with no additional dependencies. The purpose of writing this program was to learn how to create an efficient sudoku solver that can handle a variety of puzzles using Depth-First Search and Constraint Propagation while learning the TypeScript language.
