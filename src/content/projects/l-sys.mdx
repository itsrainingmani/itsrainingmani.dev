**_Lsys_** is an interactive Fractal Generator.
I came upon a wonderful <a href="https://nb.paulbutler.org/l-systems/">article</a> on generating fractals using a set of rules known as the Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems) and after reading it, I was inspired to make a website that would allow people to generate their own Fractals.
Some fractals you can generate using **_Lsys_**:
