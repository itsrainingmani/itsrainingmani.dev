**Catscii** is a Rust service built using Nix. It is based on the following series by <a href="https://fasterthanli.me">@fasterthanlime</a>

The project goes through building a simple web service that fetches images of cats from a cat API and pixelates the image. Initially the service is run on a docker container and then we go through the process of migrating it to a Nix flake.
