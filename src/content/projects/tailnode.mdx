Currently, the Tailscale Windows GUI forces you to scroll through a giant list of Mullvad VPN hostnames in order to choose an exit node. This user experience is subpar compared to other OS's and is being actively worked on by the Tailscale team.

In the meantime, I wanted a better experience for myself. I also wanted to explore making TUIs using Bubbletea.
