Alright.

We're almost halfway through this "year" and I think this is the right time to publish a post about the stuff that I want to build in 2020. No time like the present right?

So here's the list. This does not include the projects that I'm already in the middle of:

1. Simple HTTP request using TCP sockets
2. Coronavirus map
3. Conway’s game of life
4. Get hacker news into JSON
5. BASIC Compiler
6. Census Data API
7. FTP Client
8. Port Scanner
9. Prime Number Searcher
10. MD5 Implementation
11. MySQL to MongoDB Data migration tool
12. Database backup script
13. CLI Chat using sockets
14. GIF Maker
15. YouTube downloader
16. Telegram Chat Bot
17. Mobile App that broadcasts bluetooth signal
18. Country to IP API
19. SQL Query optimizer
20. Latitude & Longitude to Geohash Converter
21. Dijkstra’s maze solver
22. Website with sound boards
23. Graphing library for JS
24. Web Crawler
25. Twitter Bot that tweets AI content
26. HTML Prettifier
27. Markdown Notes app
28. Use WebRTC to make a video chat app

Pretty basic list but I think I could learn a lot by attempting to build these things.
I'll probably use a mix of TypeScript, Rust and Clojure (maybe I'll learn Kotlin or Elixir as well) to make most of them.

I'm sure this will be a fun experience.

_P.S: I know there's only 28 items on the list. I am not good at math._
