## A blog? Is this 2012? Why are you making one?

These are all questions that no one asked me when I told them that I was gonna make a blog, but I figured that it was only responsible of me to answer them anyway.

Reasons to have a blog:

- Everyone and their mothers have one
- It gives me a space to write down thoughts, musings, tutorials and anything else I can think of
- It's _cool_?

So yeah, this is my blog. Hopefully you find this just as amusing and useful as I do.

_PS: This was totally not a contrived excuse to post a random image of the black hole from Interstellar_
